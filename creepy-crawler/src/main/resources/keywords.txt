###   About:
###     The keywords.txt is an instruction set for the job filter. A Keywords object is built from this file and passed to

###     ##          new keyword class
###     #           new keyword match type
###   Matching Operations (order:
###     # IN        include jobs only with a keyword match
###     # OUT       exclude any job with a keyword match
###                     - IN/OUT are best used with only POSITION and LOCATION keyword classes to avoid over-specification
###                     - in any query of an individual class or combination of classes, a single OUT will take 
###                       precedence over all INs
###                     - in any query combination, IN must be return true for at least one keyword in ALL classes
###                       in order to return result
###     # POS       increase job upScore (+1)
###     # NEG       increase job downScore (+1)
###						- POS/NEG are to be used by only the DESCRIPTION keyword class
###   Keyword Notations:
###     k1          single keyword
###                     - generalize keyword by shortening its form (e.g. k1="stat" will match with any superstring,
###                       such as "stats", "statistics", or "thermostat")
###     k1,k2,...   keyword tuple (separated by ",")
###                     - useful for words with multiple forms (e.g. "PhD,Ph.D.")
###                     - inclusive OR operation: keyword is scored if any individual keyword from tuple is matched
###                     - scoring occurs only once per line, regardless of multiple keyword matches in tuple or job ad
